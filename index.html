	<p>Now about my first visit about my first visit to shoprite, it was a really cool experience though
	<br>i don't really remember everything  but i do remember riding the ferris wheel with my mom and siblings
	<br> everybody was scared of the falling off or being stuck in mid-air but i and my mum felt on top of the world,
	<br>after which we went and rode the animals on the merry-go-round, then mummy bought us ice creams, after
	<br> taking our ice creams we were taken to the game sections were i played different games it was really a fun
	<br> day, and then it was ifnally time to go home and on our way out we bought some popcorn and cup cakes, that's
	<br> pratically how much i can remember on my first visit to shoprite. What a day!!.</p>
